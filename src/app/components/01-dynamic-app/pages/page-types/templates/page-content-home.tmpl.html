        <h4>What is Spyne?</h4>
        <p>Spyne is a next-gen Javascript Framework designed from the ground up to efficiently develop the most demanding single-page-applications. <br/>Spyne combines traditional coding principles with reactive, functional patterns to create the cleanest, most efficient Javascript codebase. </p>

        <p>After customizing the menu, your custom application outputs a data-file, html-templates and view-components (ViewStreams) that can be further customized with Javascript, Sass and Javascript libraries.</p>
